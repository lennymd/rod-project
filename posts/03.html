      <h1>A thank you note</h1>
      <p>
        I got this in the mail from one of my students who recently graduated.
        I've been interested in teaching and mentoring students since Fall 2015
        and it's been some of the most fun I've had so far. I love the feeling
        when things click with a student and they level up their work or find a
        new direction to work with.
      </p>
      <p>
        This note arrived during a really rough week this semester when I was
        doubting myself and what I wanted to do, but it reminded me of how much
        the work I do can affect other people. I want to improve myself as a
        designer and researcher and critic so I can better help and inspire
        others.

          A note from one of the students I taught at the University of Miami.
          She graduated in May 2022 with an MFA in Interactive Media. Her
          graduation project was about creating a tool for parents to create
          picture books of their family history for their kids.

          I made this site to collect the different facets of my practice in one
          place. Not every post is long, but each post speaks to the kind of
          practicioner I am and the things I value. It's made by hand and there
          may be dead links. If you find one, let me know. All my contact info
          is on
