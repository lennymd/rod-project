      <h1>Finding a research interest</h1>
      <p>
        As a design researcher, Iâ€™m at the start of my journey to build a niche.
        Coming to Delft, I really wanted to learn enough about design to become
        a critic, but now I also want to do more active research work. Through
        my courses and interaction with faculty, I'm trying to identify the
        parts I can combine.
      </p>

      <h2>Design criticism</h2>
      <p>
        As part of my drive to understand and communicate the dynamics of the
        world, I'm always interested in learning about the context in which
        things are made. My photo editing professor,
        <a href="https://www.michaelddavis.com/">Mike Davis</a>, would always
        emphasize that a project could be broken down into 3 questions:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>What</strong> do you want to do?</li>
        <li><strong>How</strong> do you want to do it?</li>
        <li><strong>Why</strong> do you want to do it?</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The three parts are interrelated, and understanding why gives you
        clarity on how to do something. I'm interested in learning more about
        design and the context in which products are made and evolve because it
        can provide insights into how they become the way they are. If we can
        understand this, we can be more intentional when we redesign products.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another benefit of this line of work that I want to explore is that it
        would give me the tools to be a good critic for my students. If I have a
        broad design knowledge, I can offer more tailored suggestions to my
        students that can help their projects grow. At the end of the day, the
        research work I aim to do should partly be used to augment my teaching
        ability.
      </p>

      <p>In this area, I'm inspired by the work of people like:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://sarahendren.com/">Sara Hendren</a> who has this
          wonderful book on design and disability,
          <a
            href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/561049/what-can-a-body-do-by-sara-hendren/"
            ><em>What Can a Body Do?</em></a
          >
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.alexandralange.net/">Alexandra Lange</a> who
          writes so beautifully about architecture and design. Her book,
          <a
            href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/design-of-childhood-9781632866370/"
            ><em>The Design of Childood</em></a
          >, was insightful and enjoyable way to understand how childhood has
          evolved from a mostly unnoticed aspect of life to a very
          commercialized and intense period of development. I especially enjoyed
          learning about Froebel's gifts and the impact they had on educational
          development and architecture.

          opportunities to learn about the breadth of design criticism.

      <h2>Human-Agent Interaction</h2>
      <p>
        As an engineer, I was interested in robotics, but I was always flummoxed
        by the many levels of abstraction involved in developing one. Through
        the PUUE and ITD courses in TU Delft, I've become more interested in
        exploring less <em>how robots are made technically</em>, and more
        <em>how we interact with robots or agents</em>. Agents are typically
        robots, products or systems that have some level of autonomy and can
        process information. Most agents are powered by some form of artificial
        intelligence or machine learning and work through processing details
        from the world and acting based on predictions.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm inspired by the work of Nazli Cila and Iohanna Nicenboim and I want
        to explore how we can use the uncertainty associated with predictions
        agents make to make interactions with agents more transparent and
        healthy.
