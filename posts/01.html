      <h1>From engineering, to journalism, to design & Delft</h1>

      <p>
        I came to TU Delft after completing a Master’s in Photography from
        Syracuse University and teaching for two years at the University of
        Miami. Before that, I earned my bachelor’s at MIT. In my engineering
        coursework, I learned how to tackle complex situations with seemingly
        unrelated components. I developed an interest in identifying underlying
        trends in these situations that would tie the components into common
        equations. The equations illuminated the importance of the different
        variables and allowed me to gain a more in-depth understanding of their
        relations. Outside my courses, photography was my hobby; I enjoyed how a
        camera could make tangible the emotions, shapes, and relationships in a
        scene.
      </p>

      <p>
        I built on my interests in identifying trends and relationships during
        my master’s coursework in photography and interactive media. The
        flexibility of the program granted me the opportunity to work across
        different media to explore the nuances of relationships: I learned to
        produce and edit stories with photographs, video, animation, augmented
        and virtual reality, and data visualization.
      </p>

        For my graduation project, I presented the results from three endeavors
        I undertook over the course of a year and a half: a journalism
        fellowship investigating hate crimes in America, a semester as a
        full-time teaching assistant for a product design course at MIT, and my
        work to independently produce and develop a data visualization story
        about Formula One teams.

          As part of my fellowship investigating hate crimes in America I built
          an interactive story documenting our road trip. I enjoyed the
          opportunity to both be in the field meeting and interviewing people,
          and in the newsroom finding a good way to communicate the results from
          our journey. You can check the story

        After graduation, I transitioned to teaching courses at the University
        of Miami. In working with both bachelor’s and master’s students, I
        further developed my abilities to use technology to characterize and
        understand underlying trends and communicate the nuances to the students
        by developing course materials (syllabi, lectures, assignments,
        tutorials, videos) that emphasized building a common knowledge base and
        allowing room for students to further explore their own interests.
      </p>

      <p>
        I came to TU Delft to expand my abilities to break down and understand a
        situation and to work towards a PhD, so I can do my own teaching and
        research work.
