        My name is Lenny Martinez Dominguez, and I am a designer, researcher,
        and educator. In my academic and professional life, Iâ€™ve explored
        various approaches to understand and communicate the dynamics of the
        world. From engineering, I learned to deconstruct and analyze complex
        situations to develop equations that explain or predict behavior. From
        journalism, I learned to incorporate the richness of human experience in
        my understanding of the situation. By combining these disciplines in my
        design practice, I feel more confident in my ability to understand the
        current situation and create solutions and recommendations that match
        the context.

          I made this site to collect the different facets of my practice in one
          place. Not every post is long, but each post speaks to the kind of
          practicioner I am and the things I value. It's made by hand and there
          may be dead links. If you find one, let me know. All my contact info
          is on
