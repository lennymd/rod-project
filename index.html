    <h1>Lenny is reflecting</h1>
    <p>
      I'm Lenny and I'm a designer, researcher, and educator from the Dominican
      Republic and the United States. I built this blog “the long, hard, stupid
      way” to explore what those three things nouns mean and show a little about
      myself.

      <h1>Pineapple belongs on pizza</h1>
      <p>
        I think asking people how they feel about pineapple on pizza is an
        interesting way to understanding interesting to understand their
        character.

      <h1>Test</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a researcher, designer, and educator pursuing a Master's degree in
        Design for Interaction at TU Delft in The Netherlands. I'm interested in
        how humans and autonomous agents (broadly robots, smart products, and
        AI-powered entities) collaborate. Specifically, I'm interested in how
        agents communicate the reasoning of their decisions and actions, and how
        they express their uncertainty. Before moving to the Netherlands, I
        taught courses in data visualization, web design, and data journalism at
        the University of Miami. In 2018, I investigated hate crimes in America
        as a Carnegie-Knight News21 Fellow. I previously studied Photography at
        the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications, and Mechanical
        Engineering at MIT.
