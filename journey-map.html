      <p>Explorations and notes from this quarter.</p>
      <h2>
        Read Matt Stuart's book: <em>Think like a Street Photographer</em>
      </h2>

      <p>
        I read the book one evening during the week of the poetic photography
        exploration. I made a few poetic images (<a
          href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CdTi4WdNJuX/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link"
          >link</a
        >), but I did not follow the entire exploration. For me, poetic images
        are ordinary scenes where the color, or quality of light feels sublime.
        I'm always trying to make poetic images (see
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lennyisnoticing/"
          >my own Instagram</a
        >
        as reference). It's something I picked up while studying visual
        storytelling at Syracuse University.
      </p>

      <p>
        I read Matt's book because I've always struggled to make pictures in a
        place with strangers; I worry about how I'm perceived or about being “in
        the way”. Reading the book reminded me of that past fear, but it also
        helped me see how I've grown since I started making pictures. I'm more
        confident approaching and engaging people than I was before. I can
        assert myself better when making pictures, and while I still don't
        photograph strangers much, I'm working on it!
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall I enjoy my own approach to photography and while I'm trying to
        grow, I appreciate the work I make and how it makes me feel good and in
        the flow state.

      <h2>Prepare PhD application materials: cover letter, portfolio</h2>

      <p>
        As a parallel track to finishing my DfI master's, I've been applying to
        PhD positions. In preparing my CV, motivation letter, and portfolio for
        applications, I got review and revise my journey from engineering to
        studying design here in Delft.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          I started by studying engineering at MIT. I learned how to
          analytically break down situations and problems into chunks I can
          solve.
        </li>
        <li>
          I chose to study photography because it was a hobby I enjoyed, and I
          thought there was something special about documenting the world and
          the variety of stories. While I may have gone in wanting to be a
          photojournalist, I left interested in doing more than documentation.
          People's stories are important to tell, but they're not where I wanted
          to stop to create some tangible change. Also, making a career as a
          photographer is hard.
        </li>
        <li>
          While getting my M.Sc. in Visual Storytelling, I discovered data
          journalism and data visualization as a way where I could mix my
          technical knowledge with storytelling. I dove into that for a while
          and taught courses at the University of Miami for 2 years before
          coming to Delft.
        </li>
        <li>
          I chose Design for Interaction at TU Delft because it seemed to be the
          most flexible master and an environment where I could thrive. I have
          many skills, and I can move between prototyping and interacting with
          people nicely.

      <h2>Walks with Asli</h2>

      <p>
        This quarter I've been spending a lot of time hanging out and going for
        walks with my friend, Asli. In one particular late-nights walk, I
        realized that I'm really bad at venting. I bottle up the things that
        annoy me and when I try to vent, I filter it because I see how it might
        be explained. I need to work on that because it affects my personal life
        and my design work.

      <h2>Watch: <em>André and his Olive Tree</em> (2020)</h2>

      <p>
        The movie follows André Chiang as he closes his restaurant André in
        Singapore. It's a reflection on his career and his ideals. I admire
        chefs and cooking documentaries because they seem to highlight a
        similarity between cooking and designing — making something for others
        at a high level and working with different situations/ingredients.
        Towards the end of the film there were some moments that resonated with
        me:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>
          While visiting a night market, a passerby and fan wonders why he
          returned to Taiwan given that the market for fine dining is not very
          good. André's saw it differently: “I think it's a mission for me. If
          everyone believes that the environment won't improve, then it will
          never improve… I think it's up to us to create that environment and
          not expect that the environment would be right for us.” This active
          approach resonated with me as I've been working on becoming more
          independent as a designer.
        </li>
        <li>
          André is seen in his Taipei restaurant, RAW. He's giving feedback at
          the end of the briefing. He's pushing forth the point that it's
          important to review the wine list every day, even if there are no
          changes from the day before. It's a form of practice. The briefings
          are not a place to talk about the good things, but to review the
          previous day and see what could be improved. Afterwards there's a clip
          of him giving slightly firmer feedback to an employee, likely a
          manager. They have to “step up” and remind others to adjust and find
          ways to improve. Reviewing the clip, it doesn't feel eventful or
          grandiose, but it's a reminder that keeping a routine and also being
          critical and looking for ways to improve are both important to
          growing. By reinforcing our base we can become better. At least,
          that's what I took from it.

      <h2>Watch: <em>Rams</em> (2018)</h2>

      <p>
        Dieter Rams is the first industrial designer I learned about as an
        engineer. The principles he proposes for good design are indeed a useful
        and while I may not find them all applicable to the kind of design work
        I do, I am deeply intrigued by the coherence and consistency of the
        products he touched at Braun and Vitsoe. At home in the states, I have a
        collection of all of books about Dieter Rams; I even took 2 years of
        German in my bachelor's to be able to read the original German texts to
        better understand how he's portrayed and his own writing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Rewatching the documentary was also useful because it reminded me of
        something I really care about, but haven't been able to explore as much
        during my master: the communication of design. I think it's great that
        we write these reports for projects and that we explore contexts and
        come up with interventions and prototype, but I dislike that we don't
        focus on communicating the work we do. Design is so pervasive yet it's
        often seen as a tool for beautifying or making things expensive. I think
        it's really important to be able to explain the work of design to people
        who don't study it. I admire architecture critics like Alexandra Lange
        who can write about buildings and what they mean in our environment, or
        podcasts like 99 Percent Invisible that shine on little parts of the
        world that we don't often pay attention to. Gary Hustwit himself does
        this through his documentaries on various kinds of design
        (<em>Helvetica</em>,
        <em>Objectified</em>, <em>Urbanized</em>, <em>Rams</em>). I wish I was
        better at doing this, and I wonder how I can improve on my own. I'm
        still figuring out how to bring more of the journalism practice into my
        own design practice.

      <h2>Attend Dan Lockton's trial lecture on 13 June</h2>

      <p>
        I enjoyed the opportunity to attend Dan Lockton's trial lecture this
        past week because I could reflect on my own time teaching. As a person
        Dan is knowledgable and engaging, but the lecture felt a bit too
        abstract for a bachelor's course (the target audience of the trial was
        set by the hiring committee, I think) and lacked practicality. These
        ideas are nice and interesting but as a bachelor's student there has to
        be something the student can latch on to and use in their current level
        of work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Put in the same situation, what would I show? When teaching data
        journalism or web development, I aim to provide many examples for
        students to draw inspiration from. The variety helps them find an entry
        point amidst all the different ways of being a journalist or developer.
        Within this approach, I wonder sometimes if I'm too practical and not
        inspiring enough.
